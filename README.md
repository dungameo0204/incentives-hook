> **A custom Uniswap V4 Hook designed to incentivize liquidity providers with time-weighted ERC20 rewards.**

This project implements a **Liquidity Mining** mechanism directly on-chain using Uniswap V4 Hooks. Liquidity Providers (LPs) earn **SpongeCake (SC)** tokens based on the duration and amount of liquidity they stake in the pool.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Interact with the Hook via the frontend interface:

## ✨ Key Features

* **⏱ Time-Weighted Rewards:** Rewards are calculated per second. The longer you stake, the more you earn.
* **🎁 Native Reward Token:** Integrated ERC20 token (**SpongeCake** - symbol: `SC`) minted directly to LPs.
* **🔒 On-Chain Verification:** All logic regarding liquidity tracking and reward distribution happens on-chain for maximum transparency.
* **⚡ Auto-Claim:** Rewards are automatically calculated and can be claimed when modifying liquidity.
* **🛡️ Brevis Integration:** Ready for zk-Coprocessor integration for advanced volatility data verification.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system consists of the following components interaction:

1.  **User (LP):** Adds liquidity via the `ModifyLiquidityRouter`.
2.  **Pool Manager:** Handles the core Uniswap V4 logic.
3.  **IncentiveHook:**
    * Intercepts `afterAddLiquidity` / `afterRemoveLiquidity` calls.
    * Tracks `stakedLiquidity` for each position.
    * Mints `SC` tokens as rewards.
